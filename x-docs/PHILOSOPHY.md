# Stakeholder Perception Scorecard - Philosophy & Purpose

## Overview

The **Stakeholder Perception Scorecard** is an assessment tool designed to help organizations understand how business stakeholders perceive the Learning & Development (L&D) function. Built by WeLearn, this application enables organizations to gather structured feedback from stakeholders about their experience with L&D, benchmark perceptions, and identify opportunities to strengthen L&D's impact.

This scorecard is designed to be paired with a parallel L&D self-assessment using the same six dimensions. Together, these two perspectives—the stakeholder's outside-in view and L&D's inside-out view—help identify alignment gaps and prioritize improvements.

## Why This Tool Exists

Many L&D organizations invest significantly in learning initiatives but struggle to understand:

- How stakeholders actually perceive L&D's effectiveness
- Where perception gaps exist between L&D's view and stakeholder experience
- What actions will most improve L&D's impact from the business perspective
- How to benchmark stakeholder satisfaction across dimensions

This scorecard provides a structured framework to gather stakeholder feedback in approximately 10-15 minutes.

## The Assessment Framework

### The 6 Dimensions of Stakeholder Perception

The assessment evaluates stakeholder perception across six critical dimensions:

1. **Alignment to Business Strategy**  
   How well L&D understands and supports stakeholder goals and priorities.

2. **Learning Governance & Decision-Making**  
   How clear, coordinated, and effective learning priorities and decisions feel from the stakeholder perspective.

3. **Technology & Learning Ecosystem Experience**  
   How easy and connected the learning tools, platforms, and data are for stakeholders and their teams.

4. **Content & Learning Experience Quality**  
   How relevant, practical, engaging, and current the learning experiences are.

5. **Measurement, Impact & Communication**  
   How well L&D demonstrates value, measures outcomes, and shares useful insights.

6. **Culture, Change & Organizational Readiness**  
   How effectively L&D supports growth, capability building, and change across the organization.

### The Rating Scale

Each dimension contains 5 questions rated on a 5-point Likert scale:

| Score | Label                 | Description                                                                   |
| ----- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Not Yet in Place      | No formal efforts or practices are currently in place                         |
| 2     | Early Development     | Some initial steps have been taken, but efforts are limited or informal       |
| 3     | Inconsistent Practice | Practices are present but applied unevenly across the organization            |
| 4     | Consistently Applied  | Practices are well established and applied reliably across teams or functions |
| 5     | Fully Mature          | Practices are embedded, optimized, and inform ongoing strategic evolution     |

### The Perception Maturity Model

Based on total scores (out of 150), stakeholder perception is classified into one of four levels:

| Level                           | Score Range | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Reactive Perception**         | 30-74       | L&D seen as reactive, inconsistent, or disconnected from business priorities.        |
| **Operational Perception**      | 75-104      | L&D seen as reliable for core delivery, but not consistently strategic or proactive. |
| **Strategic Perception**        | 105-129     | L&D seen as aligned, proactive, and influential in performance and change.           |
| **Transformational Perception** | 130-150     | L&D seen as essential to business success, innovation, and competitive advantage.    |
