Stakeholder Perception Scorecard for L&DStakeholder Scorecard Survey — IntroductionThank you for taking a few minutes to complete this scorecard. The purpose of this survey is to understand how you and your teams experience the Learning & Development (L&D) function today. Your feedback will help us benchmark current perceptions, identify strengths to build on, and focus improvements where they will most benefit the business.You’ll rate L&D across six dimensions:1. Alignment to Business Strategy – how well L&D understands and supports your goals and priorities.2. Learning Governance & Decision-Making – how clear, coordinated, and effective learning priorities and decisions feel from your perspective.3. Technology & Learning Ecosystem Experience – how easy and connected the learning tools, platforms, and data are for you and your teams.4. Content & Learning Experience Quality – how relevant, practical, engaging, and current the learning experiences are.5. Measurement, Impact & Communication – how well L&D demonstrates value, measures outcomes, and shares useful insights.6. Culture, Change & Organizational Readiness – how effectively L&D supports growth, capability building, and change across the organization.This scorecard is paired with a parallel self-assessment that the L&D organization is completing using the same six dimensions. Together, these two perspectives—your outside-in view and L&D’s inside-out view—help us see where we are aligned, where gaps exist, and what actions will most improve L&D’s impact.Please base your ratings on your direct experience.Thanks again for helping us strengthen learning in ways that truly support the work.Purpose:This scorecard helps business stakeholders evaluate how effectively the L&D organization supports strategy, performance, and change.
